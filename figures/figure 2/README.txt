To recreate Figure 2 from the manuscript

1. Open RStudio using the covid_india_wave2.Rproj file in the project home folder

2. Run the R script `figure 2.R`

3. Open the `figure_2.pptx` file

4. Replace the panel plot in the figure_2.pptx file with the figure_2_out.pdf file in the `figure 2` folder (the output generated and saved by the figure 2.R file). There are some text boxes over the dashed vertical lines in panels A, B and C. These text boxes may need to be moved to align with the corresponding vertical line without blocking the lines in the figure.

5. Save the modified figure_2.pptx file as a PDF named `figure_2.pdf`. We opened the PDF in Preview on Mac to crop the unnecessary whitespace around the panel figure.
